## Description
SFA code for the following papers:

- Li, Dingquan, Tingting Jiang, Weisi Lin, and Ming Jiang. "[Which Has Better Visual Quality: The Clear Blue Sky or a Blurry Animal?](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8489929)." IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, vol. 21, no. 5, pp. 1221-1234, May 2019.
- Li, Dingquan, Tingting Jiang, and Ming Jiang. "[Exploiting High-Level Semantics for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment of Realistic Blur Images](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3123266.3123322)." Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Multimedia Conference. ACM, 2017.

## Requirement
Framework: [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/) 1.0 + [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) 2016b Interface

The PLSR model uesd in the test code is trained on [LIVE](http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/Quality/subjective.htm) gblur images with DMOS (the larger the worse).

Download the ResNet-50-model.caffemodel from https://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks and paste it into the directory "models/" before using the code!

## Note for training
All we need to train is a PLSR model, where the training function is plsregress.m in [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). The features are extracted from the DCNN models pre-trained on the image classification task.

Update: remember to change the value of "im_dir" and "im_lists" in data info.
